# Corda

Corda is a decentralised database system in which nodes trust each other as little as possible.

## Features

* Smart contracts that can be written in Java and other JVM languages
* Flow framework to manage communication and negotiation between participants
* Peer-to-peer network of nodes
* "Notary" infrastructure to validate uniqueness and sequencing of transactions without global broadcast
* Enables the development and deployment of distributed apps called CorDapps
* Written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), targeting the JVM

## Getting started

Firstly, read the [Getting Started](https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html) documentation. 

Next, use the following guides to set up your dev environment:

* If you are on **Windows** [use this getting started guide](https://www.corda.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Corda-Windows-Quick-start-guide-1.pdf) which also explains through how to run the sample apps.

* Alternatively if you are on **Mac/Linux**, [watch this brief Webinar](https://vimeo.com/200167665) which walks through getting Corda, installing it, building it, running nodes and opening projects in IntelliJ.

After the above, watching the following webinars will give you a great introduction to Corda:

### Webinar 1 – [Introduction to Corda](https://vimeo.com/192757743/c2ec39c1e1)
